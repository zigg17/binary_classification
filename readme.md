# Jake's Models:
This repository is meant to showcase my initial work with modeling. In order to practice my work, I have found several datasets through kaggle and began to create different models in hopes of improving both the efficiency and efficacy of my training processes. Each dataset was unique in the type of data shown and the parameters present. Additionally, all models were made with python, utilizing either pytorch, scikit, pandas, and numpy as dependencies. This markdown will present summaries of the model creation processes for each dataset, more in-depth markdowns for each dataset can be found in their respective folders.
